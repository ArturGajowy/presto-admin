Hardware Requirements

**Memory**

It is recommended to allocate at least 16 GB of RAM per node for Presto.

**Other Recommendations**

Presto can be installed on any normally configured Hadoop cluster. Presto
may be collocated with an HDFS DataNode, but it is not recommended to run Presto on a
node that is also running YARN.
